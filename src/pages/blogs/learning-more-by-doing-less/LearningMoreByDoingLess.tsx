        Recently, I decided to allocate some time to giving some thought into my
        future career path - something I'd been meaning to do for a while.
        During this period, I found a lot of useful resources from an
        organization called
        <InTextAnchor text="80000 hours." href="https://80000hours.org/" /> The
        idea behind 80000 hours is that we have approximately 80000 hours in our
        career to contribute the most 'good' for society as possible, and their
        goal is to help people figure out how best to utilize these hours. If
        you're intrigued by the idea of using your career for 'good', it's
        something I'd definitely recommend checking out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, one resource that stood out, suggested by 80000 hours, was a
        free online course called
        <InTextAnchor
          text="Learning to
        Learn"
          href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/"
        />
        facilitated by Professor Barbara Oakley. This course, available for free
        on Coursera, is also the most viewed online course in the world.
        Intrigued, I decided to try out this course a couple of weeks ago. Now,
        as I near the end of the course, I thought I'd share some key takeaways
        that I've learned so far - the central theme being 'how to learn more by
        doing less'.
      </p>

      <p>
        Something I really enjoyed about this course was its perspective on what
        it means to learn. For the longest time, I used to have a very arcane,
        one-dimensional view of learning, viewing it merely as a means to an
        end. In the classroom, you learn in order to pass a test. When you start
        to work, you learn in order to perform your job effectively. However,
        this course extends the concept of learning beyond the process of
        absorbing and internalizing new information. It goes further to include
        situations where there's no one there to teach you, no textbook, no
        Google-able answer. It's in these situations where all you have is
        yourself, your thoughts, past knowledge, and experiences, and it's up to
        you to put together the pieces to come up with new insights, discoveries
        or pieces of art. Because of this, I like to think of the process of
        learning as being split into two stages - 'acquisition' and
        'innovation'.
      </p>
      <h2>The two stages of learning</h2>
      <p>
        The first stage of learning, 'acquisition', is likely what comes to mind
        when you think about learning. This stage is about intensive focus,
        where you might spend hours, days, or even weeks mastering a specific
        topic, often for school or work. It's what's known as the 'focused mode'
        of thinking, demanding a linear approach with prerequisites fulfilled
        before advancing. Acquisition lays the groundwork, providing the
        necessary fundamentals to bring your own creativity to a subject. Some
        may find satisfaction in this stage alone, especially if their goals are
        confined to grades, job competence, or merely absorbing knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        But learning doesn't stop at acquisition; it naturally evolves into the
        second stage, 'innovation'. Far from being a rare or elite skill,
        innovation is something we all engage in daily. It's the 'diffuse mode'
        of thinking, where connections are made between what you've learned and
        your own life experiences, including in seemingly unrelated fields. It's
        the stage where problem-solving and creativity come into play, where the
        raw material of knowledge is molded into something uniquely your own.
        Whether in our work, hobbies, or daily decisions, this form of learning
        is integral to how we navigate and make sense of the world.
      </p>
      <h2>'Acquisition'</h2>
      <p>
        Looking back at my time in high school and university, I realize I was a
        terrible learner. That's not to say I got bad grades; in fact, quite the
        opposite. But reflecting on my approach to getting those grades, I'm not
        sure I retained much at all. My strategy throughout school involved a
        comfortable rhythm of waiting until the week before a test to begin
        studying. I would then attempt to cram all the required content into two
        or three all-nighters. In my mind, this was the best approach, allowing
        me to invest just a few days of intensive learning rather than an entire
        term or semester. Surprisingly, this strategy often worked well, with
        all the information fresh in my memory for the test. But if I were to
        take those same tests today, I'm confident I would fail every one of
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The acquisition stage of learning involves absorbing the basic building
        blocks that you can later build upon. To reach this stage effectively,
        these building blocks must become ingrained in you, stored in your
        long-term memory. If you're trying to 'learn' something without
        committing it to memory as a tool for future use, you're really just
        wasting your time. Reflecting on my high school and university days, I
        see now that those long nights spent cramming before a test were in the
        end a waste of time. I can't help but to think about the many hundreds
        or perhaps even thousands of hours I poured into last-minute study
        sessions, and I have nothing to show for it now. But as I look back, I
        ask myself: Was there a better way? Could I have achieved the best of
        both worlds, maintaining my good grades while crafting robust tools I'd
        be able to utilize today?
      </p>
      <p>
        Something Barbara consistently emphasizes throughout the course is the
        importance of spaced repetition, which contradicts the last-minute
        cramming many of us are used to. Itâ€™s easy to assume that spaced
        repetition, because it spreads study over more days, equates to more
        study time. However, a
        <InTextAnchor
          text="study"
          href="https://web.williams.edu/Psychology/Faculty/Kornell/Publications/Kornell.2009b.pdf"
        />
        conducted by the University of California's psychology department in
        2009 found otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the study, they compared two groups of students preparing for
        different tests. One group used the 'spacing' technique, studying in
        short increments over several days, while the other group relied on
        'massing', cramming all study materials right before the test. The total
        study time for both groups ended up nearly the same. Despite this, the
        spacing group consistently outperformed the massing group by 31%-36%.
      </p>
      <p>
        But what's intriguing about these findings isn't just this clear
        advantage of spacing over massing; it's the perception participants had
        of their own learning. Despite the clear superiority of spacing, on
        average, participants predicted the massing group would do 14% better,
        revealing a fascinating disconnect that reveals our misconceptions about
        learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        But why do we have this intuition that cramming is a superior strategy?
        The study suggests that this is because cramming feels more productive
        in the moment. During a cramming session, we're able to recall
        information more fluently, leading us to believe that we're learning
        more effectively. However, this sense of learning is deceptive, with the
        true reason for this stemming from our superior ability to retrieve
        recent information from our short-term memory. And because of the
        failure in our schooling system that revolves around test taking that
        rewards short-term memory recall, it's easy for us to fall into the
        cycle of using cramming strategies to meet our immediate goals of
        passing these tests. And, naturally, once we find something that works,
        we're unlikely to experiment with other strategies for learning. Though
        cramming may help us scrape by in these tests, the knowledge evaporates
        soon after, leaving us with many hours wasted with nothing to show for
        it except for a number or letter on a piece of paper.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's important to remember why we learn. The true purpose of learning is
        to be able to build and acquire tools of knowledge that we'll be able to
        use some day in the future, whether that be to help us get work done, or
        to build upon for making creative insights or discoveries. So when it
        comes to studying strategies, on one hand there's the admittedly
        convenient method of cramming that will help you to the extent of
        passing tests, and on the other hand there's the method of spacing out
        your learning over time, forging tools that you'll be able to use for
        the rest of your life. Take your pick.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is also a neurological argument for spaced learning. I was tossing
        between including it in this blog, so I'll instead give a brief summary.
        Anytime you start to learn something new, whether it's a new exercise at
        the gym or a new math formula, your brain creates a new sequence or
        circuit of neurons for this task. However, the connection between these
        neurons is weak at the start, and the only way to strengthen it is to
        have them fire together repeatedly. The caveat is that neurons have a
        refractory period, during which they are unable to fire again, sort of
        like a cooldown. Therefore, you have to wait for the refractory period
        to pass before you can activate these neurons again and strengthen the
        connection. This what spaced learning allows you to do. Being someone
        who failed their year 10 biology, please take all this with a grain of
        salt. If you are interested in the topic, you can learn more about it

      <h2>'Innovation'</h2>
      <p>
        Have you ever had a problem you've been stuck on only to realize the
        answer several hours later when you're doing something completely
        unrelated? Or have you ever noticed your mind racing while taking a
        shower or trying to fall asleep? These are all examples of your mind's
        diffuse mode of thinking taking over.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like to think of our mind being like a library with each book
        representing some piece of knowledge or skill we've learned during the
        acquisition stage. When we're in our normal mode of thinking (focused
        mode), we have go-to routes in our mind's library based on the task at
        hand. For example, if I run into a problem while writing a computer
        program, I won't be looking for answers in the 'cooking' section of my
        mind's library. Instead I'll probably be in the 'programming' section,
        staying there until I either find what I'm looking for or get tired and
        give up on the problem. This line of thinking works for most of our
        everyday problems. However, sometimes the answer to a problem does
        indeed lie in an unexpected section. Maybe all we needed was to look in
        the 'cooking' section after all. This is where the diffuse mode comes
        in.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the focused mode of thinking is where you have full control over
        which areas of your mind library to browse, the diffuse mode is the
        complete opposite. When you relinquish control of your mind, it starts
        to wander sporadically, pulling books off the shelves at random and
        trying to relate them to each other. While such thoughts are usually
        trivial (think of your average shower thought), this random process
        occasionally stumbles upon a stroke of genius, allowing you to make a
        connection related to your problem that you never would've otherwise
        considered.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can now see the connection between the acquisition and innovation
        stages. By building your library of tools in the acquisition stage, when
        you do enter the diffuse mode, you have a better chance of stumbling
        upon useful connections and insights. The more diverse and well-stocked
        your mental library is, the greater the potential for innovative ideas
        and creative solutions to emerge from seemingly unrelated pieces of
        knowledge. While this is good and all, does this mean innovation can
        only happen at random? Or are there things we can do to increase our use
        of the diffuse mode to harness its full potential?
      </p>
      <p>
        The best way to activate the diffuse mode is by simply 'doing less'.
        This mode arises whenever you're in a relaxing or flow state. Here's a
        quick exercise you can try now if you like: close your eyes and focus on
        your breath for two minutes, trying to keep an empty mind. Unless you're
        an experienced meditator, you'll notice your mind inevitably starting to
        flood with thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason why such a mode of thinking is so rarely accessed is because
        of the many distractions and stimuli that fill our daily lives. There is
        always something to grab our attention, demanding the use of our focused
        mode of thinking. It is up to us to put ourselves in an environment
        where these distractions are limited, allowing the mind to run free. For
        me, this environment is the gym. I have had many answers suddenly come
        to me while resting between sets. But this only works if you get rid of
        those distractionsâ€”using that rest time to scroll through Instagram
        defeats the whole purpose. The bottom line is that it's really important
        to step back from your work or studying from time to time and transition
        into an environment that lets your mind do its work, whether that's
        going for a walk or run, a bike ride, or simply having a relaxing sit
        outside in nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's a famous example of Thomas Edison that really illustrates this
        concept. Whenever Edison faced a difficult problem he didn't know how to
        solve, he would hold two metal ball bearings, sit on his chair, dangle
        his hand with the balls to the side, and try to drift off to sleep. As
        his consciousness started to fade and his grip would falter, the balls
        would fall and hit the floor, waking him up. This technique allowed his
        mind to wander freely and often led to moments of inspiration upon
        waking. Like Edison, we too can build such habits when we face difficult
        problems, saving us countless hours of banging our heads against the
        wall.
      </p>
      <h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        I find it fascinating that the diffuse modeâ€”something so powerful and
        readily accessibleâ€”is so rarely utilized. I suppose it makes sense; with
        the evolution of technology providing us with ever-increasing
        distractions, we find it challenging to access this mode. It makes me
        wonder about our early ancestors. Without today's distractions, perhaps
        their minds operated predominantly in a diffuse state, switching to
        focused thinking only when necessary. Maybe innovation was more
        commonplace for them, allowing them to create and evolve into what we
        are today.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, have I convinced you to do less yet? Sometimes, being the hardest
        worker isn't always the most effective solution. Using tools like the
        Pomodoro timer can serve as a helpful reminder to take regular breaks,
        step back from distractions, and let your mind work passively in the
        background. By doing so, you might just discover a wellspring of
        untapped creativity and problem-solving potential waiting to be
        harnessed.
